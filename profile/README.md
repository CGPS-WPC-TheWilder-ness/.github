# WPC OPERATOR:

I'm Blair, but you can call me wilder, that is if you are actually speaking to me.

The only thing I care about is being at peace with myself. The only thing that has worked for me and my various states of inner war is to treat peace as an piece-integral optimization process that never ends. I have learned that computers are in fact, superior constructs for maintaining processes. So, I invent my world piece computer, and I will never stop.

What do I do for fun? I like to apply a systems engineering-ish mindset to general tooling, general intelligence, identity creation/design, method acting, art, art, art, artchitecture, design, being as The Individual, living in The Observer, and all around having a great time by recognizing that I have inconceivably more control over my surrounding environment and state of subjective being than ever would have hoped growing up as a typical.

Alas, things changed. Now I find me one of an outlier set: those who know generalized war. However it happened, now I am not typical and well adjusted. In fact, my default is _negatively_ _a_typical. Alaslas, there are those who with romance in their eyes perpetuate damaging stereotypes buying into notions of 'endeuring atypicality' or 'good atypicality'. I actually need to exert a massive deal of effort to fit in and feel at ease. 'You are so ++ at this-that-the-other, Blair!' No. It's Wilder. Blair takes the fucking credit. Wilder exercises focus and work ethic that most find simply brutal...producing results, not wallow.

The person you love is the person you hate. The ignorant among us believe that there is such thing, the one-sided coin. Perhaps some of those who believe in 1sC(love) simply haven't met many dogs yet. Inexperience.

STOP.

(I meant me, you stop, dude. I am reeling off into spiral. I am working on properly tooling my AI programming efforts, because I gotta start actually integrating the datastreams into an accessible/replicatable package/platform. Remember, I'm basically just obsessed with building a better brain for myself. Mine somehow corrupted, and I am in need of much more help than those well meaning _typically_ afford each other, that is, without denoting one another as 'sick person status' per cultural (medical) norm, as a socially formal powerstructure formatting exchange. Tit:help::tat:submission::::comfort:discomfort.)

Back to work now. Github copilot is kinda fun. I am working now on creating a chat thead tree within a workspace to see if I can multiedit a single document more effectively and then easily stash the session into a git repo.

Wilder.

America-Day, 2024.

Fuck yeah.
